\f0\fs24 \cf0 Run \'91LeNet_model_script.py\'92 to run forward pass of LeNet convolutional neural network built from scratch. Weights of the model were obtained by training an identical model built with Keras/Tensorflow. \
\
For the program to run correctly, please ensure \'91weights.pkl\'92 and the desired image to be input to the model for prediction are both in the current working directory.}
